## Introduction
There are *several* (100+) conditions for you to choose from to allow extreme fine tuning of loot tables.  Not all conditions are treated equally, some will only apply to specific loot table types.  Conditions that are not used by all loot table types will specify which types they will work with.  All loot tables with a type of LOOT_TABLE may use any conditions, though it will be dependent on what loot table type is using the separate loot table.  Any conditions that are not valid for a loot table type will always evaluate to false and will prevent the loot table from executing.

## The Basics
Conditions determine the control flow of the loot table.  All conditions for a section must pass in order to continue to the next section.  If there are conditions listed at the top of the loot table file, they must all pass in order for the `overwrite-existing` setting to do anything.  In order for the loot table to continue processing, all conditions listed must pass.  Conditions follow the format of `condition-name:value1,value2,etc..`.  Some conditions may not require any values, in which case they would just appear as `condition-name`.

#### OR
If you want to require one condition OR another to pass, you can make a condition with the following format: `biome:forest||dimension:nether`.  With this format, only a single condition within it has to pass for it to be evaluated to true.  You may provide as many conditions as you want using this format.

#### AND
If you want to require one condition AND another to pass, you can make a condition with the following format: `block-type:netherrack&&dimension:nether`.  With this format, all conditions within it has to pass for it to be evaluated to true.  You may provide as many conditions as you want using this format.

#### Negation
Conditions can be inverted by adding a `!` at the beginning like so: `!condition-name:value1,value2,value3`.  For example, if you want any biome except for forest, use `!biome:forest`.

#### Advanced Formatting
The above properties can all be combined with the use of parenthesis `()`.  Here is an advanced example that checks if the player is using any tool other than shears or one with silk touch: `!(required-tool-type:shears || enchantment:silk_touch)`.  Any whitespace used in conditions is purely decorative.

For the `condition-chance` condition, if you wish to use `&&`, `||`, `()`, or `!` you will need to surround the condition in `{}`, such as `condition-chance:1%,{biome:desert||block:sand},10%`.  Specifically, the `{}` means anything within will be parsed separately from the current condition.
