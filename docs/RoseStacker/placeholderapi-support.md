## Introduction
RoseStacker currently provides an internal PlaceholderAPI expansion that provides a single placeholder.  You must have PlaceholderAPI installed to use the below placeholder.  Please note that as mobs cannot have relative placeholders parsed, *RoseStacker provides no placeholders for any stack type*.

## Placeholders
| Placeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `%rosestacker_spawner_silktouch_chance%` | The chance a player has to pick up a spawner using silk touch (eg. `40%`).  The output format can be configured in the locale file with the `silktouch-chance-placeholder` value. |
